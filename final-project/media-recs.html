       <!-- story summary -->
       <p class="start">
        <i>Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</i> features nine main characters, who are forced to participate in the Nonary Game by an unknown person named Zero. The characters adopt code names to protect their identities due to the stakes of the Nonary Game. The player-controlled Junpei is joined by June, a nervous girl and an old friend of Junpei whom he knows as Akane; Lotus, a self-serving woman with unknown skills; Seven, a large and muscular man; Santa, a punk with a negative attitude; Ace, an older and wiser man; Snake, a blind man with a princely demeanor; Clover, a girl prone to mood swings and Snake's younger sister; and the 9th Man, a fidgety individual.
        The events of the game occur within a cruise ship, though all of the external doors and windows have been sealed, and many of the internal doors are locked. The game's nine characters learn that they have been kidnapped and brought to the ship to play the Nonary Game, with the challenge to find the door marked with a "9" within nine hours before the ship sinks. To do this, they are forced to work in separate teams to make their way through the ship and solve puzzles to find this door. This is set in part by special locks on numbered doors that are based on digital roots; each player has a bracelet with a different digit on it, and only groups of three to five with the total of their bracelet's number with the same digital root as marked on the door can pass through.

        <hr/>
        This game starts off my favorite series, <i>Zero Escape</i>, because of it's long, entertwined narrative. This game and subsequent two in the trilogy form an incredible story of wacky anime sci-fi, heart felt character moments,
        and heart-pounding twists and turns. I like to describe it as "Kingdom Hearts, but not just complicated for the sake of being complicated." While the story is very complex and difficult to follow, it is worth it.
        When I first started playing these games, I would literally lie awake at night thinking and theorizing about it for hours. The story does not think of it's players as dumb; it expects you to try and put things together before they happen, 
        and facilitates that with the hints it gives along the way. It's a mystery story wrapped into a love story wrapped into a sci-fi death-game story. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I find that if someone endlessly annoys me to watch something, I don't, or it is tainted when I do try to watch it. (This is why I still haven't seen <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>).
        So, I try not to do that very often. However, this series is the exception. Everyone that I have pushed towards this series who plays it loves it, no matter how annoying I was to get them there. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The sequel series, <i>AI: The Somnium Files</i>, made by the same development team, is also phenomenal, especially the first game of the same tile. If you play <i>Zero Escape</i> and like it, more of the same great story waits in <i> AI</i>.
