A directory is a system of file organization on a computer analogous to a folder containing many documents and sub-folders. It is used to keep track of, store, and retrieve files at a users' command.
VCS's are useful because web/coding projects can quickly become overwhemling in the sheer amount of different versions and revisions done over the course of working on the project. A VCS allows streamlined workflow, easier collaboration, and easier recovery of lost files in a team setting.
My favorite artistic medium is interactive media like video games. There is a level of personal investment that comes with an interactive video game that can move an individual emotionally to the same or greater lengths than classic art or theatre. One should only need to play "Journey" to realize this.
