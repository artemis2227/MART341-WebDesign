        <p>
            I thought that, if I am writing out a recipe, I have to write a long, wordy, unnecessary introduction like 
            all recipes on the internet have. This recipe is special to me because I spent years of my life going to Hawaii
            every Christmas with my family. While I have mixed feelings about this time, unfortunately, <s>because maybe it 
            wasn't the best idea to take a lonely middle schooler away from her few friends for up to a month at a time during 
            the one period of the year she could spend more time with her friends</s>, but now that I am an adult I am able to 
            look back on that time and see how lucky I was and how fun many of the things we got to do were. I've always been a 
            foody as well, so I remember a lot of the foods we would eat there. From the restuarants that are long since closed 
            down to the snack foods from the convenience stores, many of my strongest memories of Hawaii have food tied to them.
            So, without further ado, here is my recipe for Spam Musubi, the greatest breakfast food known to man.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Ingredients
        </h2>

        <!-- ingredients list and semantic element #2-->
        <ul>
            <li>1 can Original Spam</li>
            <li>2 cups <dfn title="short-grain white rice">sushi</dfn> rice</li>
            <li>3 Tb <dfn title="Japanese sweet rice wine">Mirin</dfn></li>
            <li>3 Sheets Nori seaweed, cut into 2 inch wide strips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> 
            Directions
        </h2>

        <ol>
           <li>Begin cooking rice according to package directions. Don't forget to wash the rice if it is not pre-washed.</li>
           <li>While rice cooks, slice spam into 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick pieces. <strong>Rinse spam can and reserve for later.</strong></li>
           <li>Cook spam in a large skillet. Place pieces in one layer on skillet for 2-3 minutes per side at medium-high heat.</li>
           <li>Once rice is finished and drained, added mirin and mix in well. </li>
           <li>Layer about 3/4 inch of rice mix on bottom of rinsed spam can. Then add a cooked slice of spam, and layer another 3/4 inch of rice on top.</li>
           <li>Flip over can to remove layered rice and spam. Wrap Nori strip around to seal everything together. Use a bit of water to make the Nori stick to itself.</li>
           <li>Eat immediately, or wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge. Reheat for 30 seconds to 1 minute in the microwave. Great as a breakfast!</li>
